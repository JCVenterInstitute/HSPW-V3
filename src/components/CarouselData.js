      "The Human Salivary Proteome (HSP) is a collaborative, community-based Web portal to more than 1,000 unique human saliva proteins identified by high-throughput proteomic technologies. The HSP is developed for the research community and the public to harness the knowledge in the data and to further enhance the value of the proteome. You are very welcome to share your thoughts in the forums, add your own data to the growing database, annotate the proteins, or just explore the site.",
