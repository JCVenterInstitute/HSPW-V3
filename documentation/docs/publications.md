# Publications

<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/" target="_blank">PubMed</a> is a service of the U.S. National Library of Medicine that comprises more than 36 million citations of biomedical articles dating back to the 1950s. PubMed citations that are referenced by data in the HSP V2.0 including links to the PubMed articles are archived locally for your viewing convenience. Pages (e.g., salivary proteins page) citing PubMed articles list PMIDs of the articles with the prefix "PubMed:" followed by the accession number.

## Listing of Citations

**Figure 1** shows the PubMed Citations table on the [Publications](https://salivaryproteome.org/citation) page. The table lists citations that are stored in the HSP V2.0 by PubMed ID, Publication Date, Title, and Journal. The citations can be sorted based on these features by clicking on the header of the corresponding column. In addition, the top panel allows the user to search citations based on keywords. The left panel provides a suite of filtering options with “AND” relationship to further limit the search criteria.
